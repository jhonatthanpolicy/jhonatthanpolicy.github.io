            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                We've organised the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description. Here, we can describe the chart and give some context.
                As a first example, we're using a basic chart from our repo.

        <figure id="Location2"></figure>
        <figure id="Location3"></figure>
        <figure id="Location4"></figure><!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
    </section>

    <!-- Do you want to add more sections? -->
        <!-- Try copying pasting the section above -->
        <!-- You'll need to change the id of the figure "<figure id="Location3"... -->
        <!-- ... and add a new variable for the graph spec in the script at the bottom of the page -->


    <!-- This is a script, it's a way to run JavaScript code on the page -->
    <script>
        // This is a comment in JavaScript - it's a different language to HTML and CSS

        let figure_1_spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhonatthanpolicy/jhonatthanpolicy.github.io/refs/heads/main/Chart1.json";
        let figure_2_spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhonatthanpolicy/jhonatthanpolicy.github.io/refs/heads/main/chart2.json"; // We're storing the URL of the graph we want to display in a variable
        let figure_3_spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhonatthanpolicy/jhonatthanpolicy.github.io/refs/heads/main/graph3.json";
        let figure_4_spec = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhonatthanpolicy/jhonatthanpolicy.github.io/refs/heads/main/Gra%202.json"// You should have a spec for a graph in this same folder. Just specify its name here, e.g. let figure_1_spec = "chart1.json"

// We're using the vegaEmbed function to put a graph in the element with id figure_1
